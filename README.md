# SimpleMaths JS


The idea of this repo is to offer to beginners a place to contribute simple mathematical functions.

You will find the simplemaths.js file a list of basic functions, most of which are admitedly entirely redundant as JS comes with its own inbuilt functions for many of these cases.

But that is the point. This is a library where someone can come in and either refactor one of this functions to run more efficiently, or add their own functions to complete some equation.

Please jump straight in and have some fun with it
